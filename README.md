# A media player application using Python and GObject

A nix package for Alexays `mediaplayer.py` script which can be found on [https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar](GitHub).

I created the package for my own convenience.

## Usage

For development, just run `nix develop`. For building the application, run `nix build`.
